## ✨ Feature Highlights

### Multi-modal Communication
Experience realistic interviews with audio, video, whiteboard, and screen sharing capabilities. Practice explaining your designs just like in a real interview.

### AI-Powered Interviewer
Powered by OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude, the AI interviewer asks relevant follow-up questions, challenges your assumptions, and guides you through the interview process.

### Resume-Aware Problem Generation
Upload your resume and get interview problems tailored to your experience level and background. The AI adapts the difficulty and focus areas based on your profile.

### Interactive Whiteboard
Draw system architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and data models using the built-in whiteboard. Visualize your designs as you explain them.

### Comprehensive Feedback
Receive detailed evaluation reports with scores across multiple dimensions, strengths, areas for improvement, and personalized action plans.

### Local-First Architecture
All your data stays on your machine. The platform uses local PostgreSQL storage and filesystem for complete privacy and control.

### Progress Tracking
Review past interview sessions, track your improvement over time, and identify patterns in your performance.
