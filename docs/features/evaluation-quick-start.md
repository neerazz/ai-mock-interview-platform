# Evaluation Quick Start

Get started with the evaluation system to understand your interview performance.

## Understanding Your Evaluation

After completing an interview, you'll receive a comprehensive evaluation report with:

### Overall Score

A score from 0-10 representing your overall performance.

- **0-4**: Needs significant improvement
- **5-6**: Below average, focus on fundamentals
- **7-8**: Good performance, minor improvements needed
- **9-10**: Excellent performance

### Competency Scores

Individual scores for each evaluation criterion:

- Problem Understanding
- System Design Approach
- Communication Clarity
- Technical Depth
- Trade-off Analysis
- Scalability Considerations

### Strengths

What you did well during the interview:

- "Asked excellent clarifying questions about scale"
- "Clearly explained trade-offs between SQL and NoSQL"
- "Effectively used whiteboard to illustrate architecture"

### Areas for Improvement

What needs work:

- "Consider discussing data consistency models"
- "Explore caching strategies in more depth"
- "Address monitoring and observability"

### Improvement Plan

Concrete steps to improve:

1. Study CAP theorem and consistency models
2. Practice designing caching layers
3. Learn about distributed tracing tools
4. Review 3 system design case studies

## Using Your Evaluation

### 1. Review Immediately

Read your evaluation right after the interview while it's fresh.

### 2. Focus on Patterns

After multiple interviews, look for recurring themes in areas for improvement.

### 3. Follow the Plan

Work through the improvement plan steps before your next interview.

### 4. Track Progress

Compare scores across interviews to see improvement over time.

## Evaluation Metrics

### Problem Understanding (0-10)

Measures how well you:
- Asked clarifying questions
- Identified requirements
- Understood constraints

### System Design Approach (0-10)

Measures your:
- High-level architecture
- Component breakdown
- Data flow design

### Communication Clarity (0-10)

Measures your ability to:
- Explain clearly
- Articulate thought process
- Use visual aids effectively

### Technical Depth (0-10)

Measures your:
- Technology choices
- Implementation details
- Edge case handling

### Trade-off Analysis (0-10)

Measures your:
- Alternative approaches
- Pros/cons discussion
- Decision justification

### Scalability Considerations (0-10)

Measures your:
- Performance optimization
- Bottleneck identification
- Scaling strategies

## Tips for Better Scores

### Ask Questions

Always start by asking clarifying questions about:
- Scale (users, requests, data)
- Latency requirements
- Consistency requirements
- Budget constraints

### Think Out Loud

Explain your reasoning as you design:
- "I'm choosing PostgreSQL because..."
- "This could be a bottleneck, so..."
- "An alternative would be..."

### Use the Whiteboard

Draw diagrams to illustrate:
- System architecture
- Data flow
- Component interactions

### Discuss Trade-offs

For every decision, mention:
- Why you chose this approach
- What alternatives exist
- Pros and cons of each

### Consider Scale

Always address:
- How the system handles growth
- Where bottlenecks might occur
- How to scale each component
